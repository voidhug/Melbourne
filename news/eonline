Her parents and brother were first suspected, but later exonerated. The case was reopened in 2009, but remains unsolved.During the six episodes, viewers can expect to see the team re-examine crucial evidence using advanced technology and forensics, as well as recreate the crime scene by rebuilding full-scale replicas of key rooms from the Ramsey house. New theories will also be introduced and extensive interviews will also be conducted. The Case Of seems to be CBS' answer to recent true crime trend taking over the small screen, following the success of American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson and Netflix's Making a Murderer, while NBC is set to launch Law & Order: True Crime, with the first season taking a closer look at the case of the Lyle and Erik Menendez, who, in 1994, were convicted of murdering their parents.  The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey will premiere on Sunday, Sept. 18 at 8:30 p.m. ET and 8 p.m. PT on CBS."}], "crawl_time": 1470907891, "hit_count": 0, "images": [], "keywords": [], "location": "US", "model_version": "测试模型版本号", "raw_tags": ["TV", "Top Stories"], "subtitle": "E!

It was really just because he needed a change.\"It's not relief [to be done with NCIS] but it is an amazing change and discovery. Not only because that was an extraordinary, unique ride—13 years, it really felt like a circle that had gone all the way around and I really felt happy with the resolution of the character and my time on the show,\" he told reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour panel for his new CBS series, Bull. \"I wasn't burnt out by NCIS and I was ready for a new challenge. Sometimes a change is as good as a rest,\" he added.After deciding to leave NCIS, Weatherly signed on to star in CBS' new legal drama Bull, loosely based on Dr. Phil McGraw's time running a successful jury consulting business. \"Bull is a big show with a lot of characters, it's complex, it's a different part of my—I solve problems the same way as an actor but it really requires a lot different muscles,\" Weatherly explained. \"I wake up every morning and I pinch myself that I have this opportunity and I'm deeply grateful and humbled by it. The big trick for me is I'm in New York City and my family is in Los Angeles still, and my son every morning on FaceTime asks 'When are you coming home?'\""}, {"text": "McGraw joked that when he was searching for an actor to play a character based on a younger version of himself, he naturally thought of the super-handsome Weatherly. \"Obviously, we're really kind of twinkies as far as looks are concerned, he immediately came straight to mind,\" McGraw joked. In all seriousness, \"when I first met Michael and we first started talking about it, I always find people are either psychologically minded or they're not...and he so got it so quick.\"Weatherly said McGraw helped him shape the character. \"Phil is a pretty funny guy because he's incredibly smart and he understands human behavior so for me the conversations were really quick, getting right to the heart of, 'Let's find out why Bull is interested in human behavior, let's find out what are the real gears and mechanisms inside that guy.' While this isn't a biographical show, Phil is an inspiration for a very complex and super intelligent guy who understands how simple people can be but how tricky it is to find that elegant simplicity.\""}, {"text": "There are definitely similarities between Bull and the character he played for 13 years, though. \"The DiNozzo that is in him is that he has a twinkle in his eye. He appreciates human behavior. People are fascinating,\" Weatherly told a small group of reporters after the panel.\"But what it really comes down to is DiNozzo required this framework where there was somebody above him. He needed Gibbs to sort of sit on him and hold him down and mentor him. And he needed that approval and validation and that inclusion, he needed that family. Bull has this team and they have a family dynamic and he's a leader inside it. ...Unlike Gibbs, I'm not coming at it from a place of ruling by fear or intimidation. I rule with a more inclusive, Kumbaya, up with the people.\"Bull premieres Sept. 20 on CBS."}], "crawl_time": 1470907892, "hit_count": 0, "images": [], "keywords": [], "location": "US", "model_version": "测试模型版本号", "raw_tags": ["TV", "Top Stories", "NCIS", "Dr. Phil"], "subtitle": "E!

But, I mean, what can I do about a question? All I can do is the best show I can.\"CBS denied the move would happen and voiced support for Colbert.\"We have no plans to flip the two shows,\" Glenn Geller, president of CBS Entertainment, told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's really easy for people to pit the shows against each other. But they're different kinds of shows, they're different kinds of hosts. One was a known quantity to America, and the other was not. I don't think it's fair to compare the two and say, 'Well, just because one show has this, why doesn't the other?'\"Colbert clearly has the political beat down thanks to his years on Comedy Central with his Stephen Colbert character, but the struggle has been harnessing that for the a larger audience on CBS's flagship late-night series.The Late Show with Stephen Colbert airs weeknights, 11:35 p.m. on CBS."}], "crawl_time": 1470907891, "hit_count": 0, "images": ["http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2016620/rs_1024x603-160720114456-1024-stephen-colbert-071816.jpg"], "keywords": [], "location": "US", "model_version": "测试模型版本号", "raw_tags": ["Politics", "TV", "Top Stories", "Stephen Colbert", "The Late Show", "CBS"], "subtitle": "E!

Each new subplot thrown into the mix could've sustained a season on its own. Instead, it became a bit like narrative Jenga. As each storyline was added to the top, the footing just got shakier and shakier until it essentially collapsed.Not Their Story to TellThe series sure was proud of itself for beating The Bachelor to the first African-American suitor, but it seemed to struggle with whether it even had the right to tell that story. Rachel was determined to make a statement by casting Darius (B.J. Britt), but she was repeatedly told left and right that, as a well to-do white woman, this wasn't her story to tell. (Especially when she got someone shot by the police in the process.)

This season was a runaway train, plowing through story at such a pace that nothing really had the opportunity to resonate or even feel plausible.An Everlasting ProblemIn her quest to show the cynical underbelly of The Bachelor and shows of its ilk, Shapiro has twisted the idea of Everlasting so fully that we're not really sure why it's a show people would want to watch. \"So that's it, huh? This is just what we do at the end of every season now, humiliate the suitor?\" Jay (Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman) asked Quinn in last night's episode. That's not what The Bachelor does.

How am I supposed to get up the stairs?\" Luckily, Kylie found her footing and struck a confident pose. \"Mission accomplished!\" Kris said.It's sure to be a fun night for the entire family.

While your appearance may not be the most urgent thing on your list of worries, sometimes finding easy ways to look your best each day can provide that extra surge of confidence that makes the other things just that much easier to tackle.Here are some of the most effective, simple changes I made to help myself feel more confident and put together during the past eight months:Prepare a Capsule Maternity WardrobeYour pregnancy will be made that much smoother if you can put a little time aside to create a capsule wardrobe that makes getting dressed every day effortless. Usually, a \"capsule wardrobe\" is comprised of 35 pieces (example: seven pair of shoes, seven tops, seven bottoms, seven dresses and seven pieces of outerwear/coats). Ideally, most of the items should all be able to mix and match and you should love every piece, making getting dressed on an ordinary day the easiest, most thoughtless process possible, because, let's face it, you have more important things to think about. It is even said that geniuses like to wear the same thing every day because it's one less thing to focus on. (Ever noticed Mark Zuckerberg is always in that same grey T-shirt?)The further along I get in my pregnancy, the more I appreciate the capsule wardrobe. Not only do I feel more uncomfortable and bloated than ever, but I am tired, emotional and experiencing the lovely brain drain that comes with these hormonal fluctuations. Right now, I need to spend my final month being as productive as I can be before this new baby arrives rather than waste my time rifling through my closet every morning, only to feel dissatisfied with whatever ill-fitting, poorly thought out thing I managed to throw together."}, {"text": "In the first trimester, you may not have to change up your wardrobe so much. Months four and five are when your body really starts changing, so that's a good time to start putting together a capsule wardrobe that will make your morning routine for the rest of your pregnancy easier.Everyone's body changes in a different way, and everyone had different preferences when it comes to what they look like, so my \"problem areas\" may not be yours, but here are examples of guidelines I created for my wardrobe in order to flatter my body in a way that I liked: I focused on comfortable dresses, versatile pants, extra-long tops and flattering coats. I was able to find most of what I needed online and for affordable prices. For a capsule wardrobe, it's good to keep it classic, stay away from trends and stick to a color scheme you know looks good on you (I chose neutrals and jewel tones).I usually like to stick with shorter or clingy, below-the-knee dresses, since my legs stay (somewhat) thin during pregnancy and a floor length muumuu just makes me feel like I'm wearing a tent."}, {"text": "I tend to put on weight in my upper arms, so I like a maternity dress (or any stretchy dress a few sizes larger than what I would usually wear) with a bit of a sleeve. My hips and thighs are another area I was insecure about, and I found that coats were a good way to disguise those parts. After noticing pregnant Kim Kardashian and Chrissy Teigen often wearing light dusters over their dresses-I adopted the look myself. The coats covered my hip and thigh area, putting the attention back on my bump. A light trench coat can have the same effect.When it comes to pants, I give maternity jeans the thumbs down. Not only are they generally not as cute as regular jeans, but denim is constricting enough that they started to not fit during my last month. If anything could make me feel like I was putting on way too much weight, the fact that my MATERNITY JEANS no longer fit pretty much did it. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life! I found that a black legging or a vinyl look maternity pant, capable of stretching with me, served me much better.Stock Up on StockingsMy legs (a feature I don't give much thought to usually) look like a damn mess when I am pregnant. Since pregnancy increases blood volume by 50 percent, pronounced veins show up out of nowhere. I also cut the spray tans while pregnant, which is what I usually rely on to help the skin on my legs look smooth and even. Since I no longer have a good tan to masquerade my bruises and veins, I stock up on tights and pantyhose for every time I wear a dress. Is there anything that sounds frumpier than the word pantyhose? Probably not, but they came in handy for me. Be sure to avoid anything labeled control top-I brought a pair home by mistake and regret it-the waist was so tight underneath my belly that it hurt! I make sure I have nude, sheer black and a variety of black patterned tights on hand so that I have something to go with any outfit and don't have to give anymore thought to my preggo legs."}, {"text": "Travel Light While You CanYou will be burdened with a big, messy diaper bag soon enough. Enjoy your freedom and carry a small purse with you while you can. If you are one of those (like I was, before my first child) who constantly sport the big, bottomless, Mary Poppins bag, consider taking a break and find a small, chic daily handbag that you love. Trust me, you'll get sick of the giant bag soon enough.Alter Your Skincare RoutinePregnancy can cause some major changes in your skin, so be prepared to alter your skincare routine. Before I was pregnant, I was using all kinds of preventative, anti-aging products on my face. One of these products contained retinol, which is not considered safe for pregnancy, so I ditched that for the time being. All my other products were too drying on my newly dehydrated skin, so I switched to using La Mer under a simple SPF every day (some drugstore brands like Nivea and Curel make more affordable alternatives).Since pregnancy hormones have caused some discoloration in my skin, I usually wear a light foundation, like L'Oréal True Match when I go out. After the baby is born, fade creams or laser treatments can make the discoloration go away.If breakouts start to plague you, look for products with alternative ingredients to retinol, such as washes and creams containing tee tree oil, benzoyl peroxide or glycolic acid."}, {"text": "Experiment With Your Makeup Instead of Your HairOne piece of advice I see a lot on pregnancy blogs is \"try a radical new hairstyle!\" I don't really understand this one. It seems to me that the moment you are dealing with crazy hormonal fluctuations and other changes in your body is probably not the best time to cut off all your hair or try a new color, particularly since these changes aren't always that easy to reverse if you aren't happy with them. If you want to change up your look, I recommend experimenting with makeup instead. Find some good makeup tutorials and master that one thing you always wished you got down but never did: how to camouflage your dark circles (you'll need this after baby comes), how to draw the perfect cat eye liner or master that contouring trick you always wanted to pull off."}, {"text": "Don't Forget LingerieEven though I am, for the most part, the only one that sees it, there is something about having my lingerie game on point that makes me feel extra put together. This is no exception during pregnancy. The idea of \"maternity underwear\" can be kind of depressing, but there's no need to wear granny panties that cover your entire bump and dowdy sports bras if you don't want to.During your first trimester, organize your lingerie drawers and throw out anything that makes you feel less than fabulous. Start stocking up on flattering bottoms that are stretchy enough to grow with you, because the last thing that's going to feel good is your pre pregnancy g-string cutting into your skin when you are already uncomfortable and cranky. I like lace thongs with wide waistbands, because they are light and elastic enough to stretch with me, but the lace look is still sexy.Depending on how much your breasts grow, you may need to stock up on larger bras, but there's not really any need to switch from the type of bra you are already comfortable in. If you like underwire, you don't have to switch to a frumpy sports bra just because you are pregnant.Though there are some cute nursing bras out there, the selection isn't that large and you probably won't want to spend a ton of money on bras you will only use for a few months, keeping your purchases mostly nude and black helps create a maternity lingerie wardrobe with color matched sets always on hand.For more exclusive pregnancy advice from Holly Madison, watch E!

The supermodel-turned-actress has been all over the media lately for her upcoming film Suicide Squad, and lots of press events equals lots of outfits. For Cara, that means unlimited amounts of sheer.For starters, this outfit doesn't only have one see-through aspect, but three: a sheer bodysuit, skirt and jacket (notice the sleeves from the elbow down). It's the perfect barely-there combination to complete this gothic-ballerina look. But how can you pull off this full-on-sheer look IRL? Take the model's advice and mix your sheer with a little leather. If you're looking for something lighter (because, well, it's summer), try a lace bodysuit and pair it with a leather skirt."}, {"text": "A Peter Pan-esque, collared school-girl dress can come across a little boring, so what really makes this outfit aspirational is the modern details (like the red textured fabric with the billowy sleeves). If you want to strike the right balance of tasteful and cool, go for a dress with a high neckline and transparent sleeves. You'll make a great impression no matter the crowd or vibe."}, {"text": "Between the long-sleeved blouse, knee-highs and intricate mini skirt, Cara's barely showing any skin. In cases like this, what you do show then needs to make a statement. We're all for a bare leg, but to add some texture (or if it's chilly outside) a sheer stocking or fishnet tight will add that sexy edge you're looking for."}, {"text": "Double the sheer, double the fun. A traditional mini skirt is a classic pairing, but what really makes this outfit unique is the bell-sleeved top layered over a lacy bra. Can you say sheer-on-sheer action? Try this at home with a lacy bralette (that will always work under any tank) and team it with any style see-through top you might own to show it off."}, {"text": "When you think of business-appropriate attire, mesh netting probably doesn't come to mind...however, Cara's playful jumpsuit is making a case for it. It's tailored and all-black, which feels really professional, and the hint of sheer at her neckline keeps it trendy and fun. The takeaway? An asymmetrical cut that doesn't show too much skin adds fun textures to your look as long as you keep the goods covered."}], "crawl_time": 1470907937, "hit_count": 0, "images": [], "keywords": [], "location": "US", "model_version": "测试模型版本号", "raw_tags": ["Fashion", "Style Collective", "Top Stories", "Cara Delevingne", "Shopping", "5 Days, 5 Ways"], "subtitle": "E!

Whether it's makeup removal with Vaseline or shampooing with a bottle of coconut oil, A-listers know a good buy when they see it.Sure, they have glam squads and stylists that transform them for red carpets, but they're the first to admit all of it has to be returned, so when it comes time to actually swiping that credit card, these are the tips, tricks and places that some of your favorite celebrities swear by:1. Shania Twain swears by the product Bag Balm for really dry skin. \"When my skin's really dry, I'll rub it over my face and on my hair, then leave it there all day,\" she told Now magazine. A large jar of the moisturizing product will cost you only $8.49 on Amazon.2.

Her Juicy TracksuitsThere was a time when every famous lady in Hollywood could not run errands around town without sporting a colorful velour Juicy tracksuit—including Kim herself. Before her closet was filled to the brim with Balmain and the likes of other haute couture labels, she donned many of the fashion trends of the early 2000s, including those signature two-piece outfits. 2. Her HairlineWhen looking at earlier photos of Kim, you might notice baby hair peaking out from her hairline that can't be found today. That's because she had them permanently removed back in the day. \"I lasered my baby hairs off years ago because my forehead had all these little baby hairs and I would always break out because of them,\" the reality star wrote on her website this year. \"Every photographer would photoshop them out anyway, and I thought I looked better without the baby hairs, but now I miss them.\""}, {"text": "3. Her Hoop EarringsIn addition to the Juicy tracksuits, there was one other element of Kardashian's look that constantly made an appearance—her hoop earrings. Years before she was a mom of two, Kim would sport all different versions of the traditional style. However, as her overall look evolved, she traded in the hoops for diamond studs and other more minimal jewelry styles. 4. Her Waist BeltsWho could forget the chunky belts that highlighted every woman's waist in the early 2000s? Kim was a fan of cinching virtually every blouse or dress. Today, she's ditched the accessory in favor of streamlined tailored silhouettes, like body-con dresses. No belt necessary!5. Her Bombshell HairBefore hairstylist Jen Atkin began crafting some of the most copied sleek hairstyles on Kim, the fashionista sported a different signature look. The extensions were long and the hair was voluminous. However, she's toned down the trend since then and has experimented with shorter, textured cuts."}], "crawl_time": 1470907941, "hit_count": 0, "images": ["http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201675/rs_1024x759-160805123432-1024kim-kardashian-1990s.jpg"], "keywords": [], "location": "US", "model_version": "测试模型版本号", "raw_tags": ["Fashion", "Top Stories", "Kim Kardashian", "kardashian news"], "subtitle": "E!

You're wearing a size too small. If there's ever a time to put vanity aside and purposely go a size up in your clothes, it's with your underwear! Too-tight skivvies can pinch and give you muffin top or VPL (visible panty line), not to mention increase your chances of nether-region unpleasantness like a UTI or yeast infection.2. You're wearing the wrong underwear with that outfit.A thong may prevent VPL, but it's not always the best underwear for your body-con clothes. If it's made from textured lace, for example, it will still show through a tight, lightweight dress. A better choice in this case might be a seamless boyshort, especially one with slightly longer \"legs\" to prevent ride-up. Wearing a high-waisted skirt? Try a high-waisted brief vs. a low-rise bikini to help smooth out the tummy area.3. You're buying underwear without lay-flat seams.Consider lay-flat, or \"hidden,\" seams your BFF in the underwear world. If seams (both outer and inner) aren't flat, particularly across your waistband and booty, your skivvies will inevitably bulk up under clothing, create VPL (yes, even if it's a thong) and cause irritation against your skin.White Rabbit ‘The Prince', $16; Hanky Panky Lace Low Rise Thong, $20; Yummie by Heather Thomson Emilie Mid-Rise Stretch Jersey Briefs, $10"}, {"image": {"image_info": {"format": "JPEG", "height": 400.0, "name": "148-785260-2", "qr_code": false, "ratio": 2.56, "width": 1024.0}, "norm_name": "148-785260-2"}, "text": "ESC: Lingerie"}, {"text": "4. You're wearing mesh underwear in the summer.It may seem like mesh underwear is more breathable, but you'll be surprised to hear it's not. Synthetic materials such as polyester hold and trap heat, moisture and bacteria—putting you at greater risk for yeast infections and UTIs, not to mention just feeling uncomfortable all day. In the summer, it's best to wear underwear made with natural, breathable materials such as cotton or bamboo that absorb and/or wick moisture away from the skin.5. You're wearing white underwear with your white clothing.This may sound good in theory, but think again. Unless your skin tone is stark white, the contrast of the underwear against your skin will cause it to show through white clothing. Instead, wear underwear closest in color to your skin tone, which will literally disappear underneath clothing.6. You're wearing light underwear with your dark-colored clothing. Most people (we hope!) know not to wear dark underwear through light-colored clothing, but did you know you can also see light underwear through dark-colored clothing? Especially if a camera flash is involved. You're literally airing your dirty laundry. So if you're wearing a black dress, it's best to stick to black skivvies. Stella McCartney Smooth & Lace Stretch-Jersey and Lace Thong, $35; I.D.

You're putting your underwear in the washing machine (or worse yet, in the dryer).Both hot water from the washing machine and heat from the dryer can ruin the stretch of your underwear. What's more, skivvies made with delicate materials such as silk or lace can easily get tangled or torn with zippers, buttons and other hardware from your other clothes. To extend the life of your underwear, it's best to hand wash and hang to dry. If you must machine wash, do so in the gentle cycle and always inside a mesh lingerie bag.8. You're not spending enough on your skivvies. It's tempting to save money on your skivvies and spend it on that pair of heels instead—after all, that's what everyone will see. But even if you are the only one who ever sees your underwear, remember that this is the foundation to your entire look. The right underthings have the power to literally make or break how you walk, talk, look and feel throughout any given day. A $5.00 pair of underwear may seem like a good deal at first, but most likely won't stand the test of comfort, or time. The cheaper the underwear, the lower the quality—expect materials that are rough against your skin, exposed seams that dig-in as well as show through clothes, underwear that's not lined properly, or ill-fit that can cause ride-up, among other things. Good quality underwear, on the other hand, will be made with first-rate materials for comfortable, all-day wear, superior attention to fit and will hold both its appearance and fit after numerous washings (hand-washings, that is!).L'Agent by Agent Provocateur Odessa Embroidered Stretch-Tulle Briefs, $50; Nordstrom Lingerie Large Lingerie Wash Bag, $8; ARAKS Isabella Cotton-Jersey Briefs, $42"}], "crawl_time": 1470907937, "hit_count": 0, "images": ["http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201674/rs_1024x600-160804170205-1024.Lingerie-Underwear-Shopping-guide.gif", "http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201674/rs_1024x400-160804170204-1024.2..Lingerie-Inderwear-Shop.jpg", "http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201674/rs_1024x400-160804170204-1024.3..Lingerie-Inderwear-Shop.jpg", "http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201674/rs_1024x400-160804170204-1024.Lingerie-Inderwear-Shop.jpg"], "keywords": [], "location": "US", "model_version": "测试模型版本号", "raw_tags": ["Fashion", "Style Collective", "Top Stories"], "subtitle": "E!
